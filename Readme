# QGIS Day 3 – Georeferencing & Digitizing Bangalore (1924)

This repository contains my **Day 3 QGIS learning mini-projects** where I worked on:
1. **Georeferencing** – Aligning a historical map of Bangalore (1924) with a modern OpenStreetMap basemap.
2. **Digitizing** – Mapping and categorizing lakes (Healthy, Partially Lost, Lost) to visualize urban change over time.

## **Project Overview**
- **Software:** QGIS (Georeferencer & Digitizing tools)
- **Data:**
  - Historical Bangalore Map (1924) – Public Domain
  - Basemap: OpenStreetMap (EPSG:3857)
- **Tutorial Credit:** Ujaval Gandhi – Spatial Thoughts

---

## **What I Learned**
- How to load and georeference scanned historical maps.
- How to use snapping tools and digitize polygons.
- How to categorize vector features based on attributes (Healthy, Partially Lost, Lost).
- Styling layers using categorized renderer in QGIS.

---

## **Outputs**
- Georeferenced historical map overlay (GeoTIFF).
- Digitized lake polygons with attributes.
- Styled map layouts for visual comparison.

### Sample Output:
![Digitized Bangalore Lakes](Bangalore%20Lakes%20mapping%20from%201927%20to%20present.png)
